**🔗 Tableau Dashboard:**  
[View on Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mateus.gomes5214/viz/A1FinalDashboard/Dashboard)

The dashboard includes:
- **Portfolio allocation by asset class** (equities, fixed income, commodities, alternatives)
- **Top and bottom performing tickers** (e.g., UNG, PFIX vs CNBS, FLT)
- **Risk vs Return scatter plot**
- **Historical price trends**
- **Sigma (volatility) and average return breakdown**

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

- PFIX and UNG had top returns, driven by interest rate hedging and energy market trends.
- CNBS and CHTR underperformed due to regulatory and competitive sector challenges.
- KMLM had the highest risk-adjusted return; UPAR the lowest.
- PANW (cybersecurity) led long-term growth, while FLT showed downward pressure.
- The portfolio showed an aggressive strategy, skewed toward equities and alternatives.

## 🎯 Recommendations

- **Diversify further** by increasing fixed income exposure
- **Phase out** underperformers like CNBS and FLT
- **Expand top positions** in UNG, PFIX, and PANW
- **Combine** high-return assets with lower volatility options
